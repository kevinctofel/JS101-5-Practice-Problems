// One of the most frequently used real-world string operations is that of "string substitution," where we take a hard-coded string and modify it with various parameters from our program.

// Given this previously seen family object, print the name, age, and gender of each family member

// Example: (Name) is a (age)-year-old (male or female).

let munsters = {
  Herman: { age: 32, gender: 'male' },
  Lily: { age: 30, gender: 'female' },
  Grandpa: { age: 402, gender: 'male' },
  Eddie: { age: 10, gender: 'male' },
  Marilyn: { age: 23, gender: 'female'}
};
for (let person in munsters) {
  console.log(`${person} is a ${munsters[person].age}-year-old ${munsters[person].gender}.`);
}
